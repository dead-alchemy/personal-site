				The pandemic changed everything in March 2020, including the way
				we work. Now, as we transition back to the office, we must find
				new ways to stay productive and focused. For the last three
				years I have manicured and tailored my workspace at home to
				accommodate my ADHD. Now as pandemic winds down, my work has
				started opening it’s doors and recommending to come back into
				the office. I have taken this torch and have started coming back
				to our beautiful and accommodating office about 2-3 times a
				week. This transition has been hard in large part due to my
				ADHD. Being productive at the office has been a challenge, but
				not an obstacle that can’t be overcome.
			</p>

			<p>
				Surviving the transition of a changing workspace is hard,
				especially when you are a little more neuro diverse than most. I
				have been able to keep or change a few rituals to keep me close
				to as productive as if I was home while in the office. These
				changes have really helped me and how I deal with my brain’s
				different approaches to environments and problems. Working the
				office is great. Helping and interacting with my team is even
				better, and in large part the reason why going back into the
				office is fulfilling. However, you can’t succeed in your own
				roles if distractions keep you from completing your own task.
				These are the lessons I have learned that have kept me close to
				as productive at home as in the office.
			</p>
			<h3>Staying Medicated and Mindful of your Differences</h3>
			<p>
				Understanding your brain and how you are different is critical
				in keeping successful and productive. One cannot ignore a
				problem away, especially if the problem is how easily your
				attention can be diverted away. Being mindful of my disorder has
				been critical so when I reflect at the end of the day about the
				wins and fails of the day, I can chalk up problems to my
				disorder (when appropriate), and how to solve them for the next
				day. Remembering you are different, and that you need different
				things to stay successful is ok and a key part of keeping
				productive regardless of our environment.
			</p>

			<p>
				Another key to success is staying medicated. In my state, it has
				been hard to keep up a prescription due to{" "}
				<a href="https://www.acsh.org/news/2023/03/31/acsh-asks-where%E2%80%99s-adderall-16973">
					Adderall shortages
				</a>
				. However, it’s critical to keep up your medication as
				prescribed by your doctor. For me, medication is a great tool to
				keep my grounded, calm, and collected. If you are thinking about
				making any changes to your medication or regime, please work
				with your doctor to make sure that is the right choice. In my
				case about a half hour before I start my commute, I make sure I
				take my medication so it’s working by the time I sit down and
				start my day in the office.

			<h3>Bringing Home to the Office</h3>
			<p>
				Part of the success that I have working from home is that I am
				able to use the tools that I want. I love my{" "}

					Logitech G915 TKL keyboard
				</a>{" "}
				and my{" "}
				<a href="https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/gaming-mice/pro-wireless-mouse.910-005270.html">
					Logitech Pro Wireless Mouse
				</a>
				. I find not having these when working distracting to a fault as
				I compare other keyboards provided at work to these great
				products. Instead of comparing what I have at the office versus
				at home, I just bring them to work. I wish I could bring my
				whole office at home to work, but alas, it makes more sense to
				have everyone use standard issue equipment instead of
				accommodating to a handful of employees.
			</p>
			<p>
				Why is bringing home to the office so important to stay
				productive? I have solve this workflow at home with some
				equipment and rituals. Keeping these rituals and equipment as
				similar as possible between environments is important to ensure
				my success. Having differences between workflows and traditions
				at home and in the office is distracting, and can remove my
				particular train of thought of the task at hand instead and into
				why I like or dislike the differences. Keeping things as close
				as possible to home as it is at the office has been a huge
				factor of my success in transitioning back into the office.

			<h3>
				Finding Ways to Minimize Distractions; Long Live Noise
				Cancelling Headphones
			</h3>
			<p>
				Over hearing coworkers talk about the recent buzz around town,
				problems about their current project, or just talking in general
				is enough to rip my out of my focus and into their problems or
				issues. Long live the{" "}
				<a href="https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/">Air Pods Pro</a>{" "}
				and their great noise cancellation. Here I can be apart of the
				team, with just enough sensory deprivation to keep me focused in
				my tasks. Its amazing what little background noise and
				deprivation can do to keep one with ADHD productive. At home I
				do not have the pleasure of having my team next to me, but I
				also don’t have anyone at home to take me away from my task.
			</p>
			<p>
				The other way to keep distractions at bay for me is to move to a
				dedicated meeting space when meetings are required. Having other
				people take meetings next to you can be vexing, however, seeing
				someone constantly distracted by their surroundings during a
				meeting can be even worse as you aren’t sure they are even
				focused on what you are saying. It is ok to move your whole
				workspace, if it can be done for a short amount of time, to
				focus on a meeting or a hard task for a short time to minimize
				the distractions your current environment may have.
			</p>
			<p>
				These are the three biggest factors that have helped my stay
				productive while transitioning back into the office. It has been
				hard, and I don’t feel as if I am as productive as if I was at
				home, but these factors have helped me get pretty close.
				Transitioning back to the office after working from home can be
				challenging for anyone, but it can be especially difficult for
				individuals with ADHD. However, by staying mindful of your
				differences, staying medicated as prescribed, and bringing the
				tools and rituals that work for you from home to the office, you
				can increase your chances of success. Minimizing distractions
				through the use of noise-cancelling headphones or other methods
				can also help you stay focused on your tasks. With the right
				approach and mindset, you can thrive in the office and continue
				to be a valuable member of your team.
