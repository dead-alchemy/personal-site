				Most individuals in any sort of business or customer facing role
				have had to deal with hard customers or users. Whether it was
				the vault of the business or the vault of the user, it can be
				taxing to one’s patience to have to deal with these “bad” users.
				These bad users come in every shape and size. Whether it is a
				fault of one’s personality, lack of empathy, or little trust in
				the process, there are ways one can navigate a bad user. What if
				the customer isn’t bad. What if they are toxic and actively
				hamper one’s development process. Here we will navigate how one
				should deal with negativity and toxicity when trying to make a
				product for them.

				Surviving the transition of a changing workspace is hard,
				especially when you are a little more neuro diverse than most. I
				have been able to keep or change a few rituals to keep me close
				to as productive as if I was home while in the office. These
				changes have really helped me and how I deal with my brain’s
				different approaches to environments and problems. Working the
				office is great. Helping and interacting with my team is even
				better, and in large part the reason why going back into the
				office is fulfilling. However, you can’t succeed in your own
				roles if distractions keep you from completing your own task.
				These are the lessons I have learned that have kept me close to
				as productive at home as in the office.

				In the book User Centered Design, Lowdermilk helps us understand
				how to deal with negativity. Me mentions that a commitment to
				staying positive is a great place to start when dealing with
				negative users. Framing a problem is the first step one should
				take when problem solving, and the same is true for working with
				bad customers. Frame the problem, focus on your own positivity,
				and try to understand why they are being negative. Did the user
				have a bad experience in the past? Are they not confident in
				their own abilities and need to be toxic to be heard? Regardless
				of the situation we should remain positive and confident in the
				face of adversity.

				The next piece of advice we can provide is to have a candid and
				open conversation with your bad user. The{" "}
				<a href="https://hbr.org/2018/04/4-ways-to-deal-with-a-toxic-coworker">
					Harvard Business Review
				</a>{" "}
				provides this tip in candid terms, as we should also be candid
				with our customer. It is possible they do not know that they are
				being that negative. It is also possible that no one has told
				them that they are treating others poorly. It’s hard to say
				without this open conversation. We need to be honest with
				ourselves and our users. Our toxic users will not know what we
				are feeling if we do not communicate with them. Like any
				relationship, all are built on communication. Communication is
				the key to understanding and gaining perspective.
			</p>
			<p>
				Lastly, we may need to fire our customer. Our first priority
				should always be ourselves and our business. If we cannot take
				care of ourselves, we cannot take care of our other customers.
				Sometimes, regardless of the situation, we need to let go of our
				bad customers. We will be happier, and our other customers will
				be happier. We cannot get far if there is a 45-pound weight over
				our neck, and sometimes customers can feel like that. If all
				else fails, and we have tried every avenue to make our users
				happy, and they still are not, maybe you weren’t the best
				individual for the role. Maybe they were not the best customers
				for us to take on. Regardless, it’s alright to let people go to
				find their own way.
			</p>
			<p>
				Dealing with bad customers is like working through a rocky
				relationship. Communication, patience, and setting expectations
				are key for our relationship to bloom. If after counseling,
				remediation, and communication the relationship is still bad, a
				breakup might be in order. As hard as it is to say goodbye to
				someone, we have been close with it’s often for the best for our
				individual growth and happiness.
