			<p>*** Spoilers for the Main Campaign of NieR: Automata*** </p>
			<p>
				I recently ended my playthrough of NieR Replicant
				ver.1.22474487139 and was touched on the story and premise it
				delivers. I won’t go into any details regarding Replicant, but
				as I was playing, I marveled on how much was learned and
				improved upon in NieR: Automata. I wanted to play through the
				2017 masterpiece and make notes on my thoughts what touched me
				in each ending. I want to talk about the merits of this game and
				put to writing this feeling I get whenever I think or talk about
				NieR. Something about this game with the ugly aesthetic,
				stunning music, and memorable main characters just clicks on so
				many levels that I am compelled to share to the whole world.
			</p>
			<p>
				The best place to start talking about NieR: Automata would be
				the soundtrack. After finishing Replicant I was stunned on the
				absolute beauty and the themes each song gives. When revisiting
				Automata, the beautiful use and transformation of each of the
				main themes invoked emotion in me. Using subtle musical themes,
				the game reminds us that this Automata takes place in the same
				world as Replicant. As the most epic of set pieces unfold, I was
				reminded on battles on the Aerie, about Kaine’s grandmother, and
				other fights for pure survival. Automata’s soundtracks hold no
				punches when trying to evoke emotion through music, but the
				punch may hit a more sensitive spot if one took the time to play
				its older brother.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the same vein on how Replicants soundtrack effects Automata
				of there are hints and foreshadowing on the ultimate plot revel
				in Automata. Automata is relying on the player to be educated as
				it doesn’t give you all the information you need. The audience
				is only superior if you have taken the time to make yourself so.
				Through subtle hints and dialogue a player is quickly able to
				tell on the fate and status of the world. The best example I can
				give on this matter is the masked robots in the desert, as they
				modeled their culture based on the desert people in Replicant.
			</p>
			<p>
				One does not need to play Replicant to enjoy Automata as it’s
				perfectly capable of standing on its own two feet. The
				transition from melee combat to bullet hell set pieces are
				beautiful ways to tell the player dialogue and things that are
				happening outside of the character while still advancing the
				story. I enjoy the mix up on the games flow as I find both
				enjoyable. The combat and gameplay loop of this game I find
				relaxing while working on finding pieces of story to sink my
				teeth into.
			</p>
			<p>
				Stories like the animal sanctuary in the forest, tales of
				revenge against mortal enemies, or individuals swooning over a
				philosopher. The side quests in the game are marvelous. In my
				first play through I maybe did 2 or 3, but not nearly the amount
				I have accomplished in this first play through. I feel I am not
				playing Automata for its combat. I am playing for the small
				stories of those fighting for their meager claims of existence
				or trying to justify that they should exist. Automata does a
				fantastic job of delivering clean and though provoking stories
				that are sprinkled through out it’s main campaign.{" "}
			</p>
			<p>
				But the creme de la crème is the main story and the struggle
				that 2B goes through in her love for 9S. 2B refuses to take make
				any attachment to 9S until he goes missing. There are small
				attempts at her dipping her toes in the water of affection
				towards Nines, but ultimately is shut down until 2B and 9S are
				reunited after his events with Adam. She simultaneously exists
				to protect 9S and kill him should he grow too strong. She has
				probably done this hundreds, if not thousands of times. I could
				not imagine living a fate where you must kill the ones you love
				at the drop of a hat, only for that person to come back with no
				recollection of you.
			</p>
			<p>
				As I play through the second time, I find it ironic that the
				robots are justifying their free will to the androids, but they
				themselves have none. Automata’s story is about 2B and 9S
				fighting to decide their own fate instead of having a shame
				council decide it for them. 2B looks overjoyed to the fact that
				9S has found a way to escape the fate of her hands, as now it
				could be time for 2B and 9S to make their own stories.
			</p>
			<p>See you when I beat ending B.</p>
