				This is the eulogy I wrote for my grandfather and best friend
				Jorge Ortega. Jorge was born on September 8th, 1932 in Santa
				Barbara, Mexico. For 30 years he was my best friend and mentor.
				I just wanted to post what I had written for him so the whole
				world can read how much of an amazing person he was.
			</p>

				My grandfather was the most hardworking person I have ever met.
				He is the definition of the self made man. He taught me the
				importance of hard work, determination, and never taking no for
				an answer. One of the greatest lessons that he imparted to
				everyone is that in life there are no failures. There are set
				backs, lessons we can learn, but importantly there is always a
				way forward. This stubbornness to never admit defeat is
				something that we can all learn and take away from. Always was
				the shoulder to the grindstone.
			</p>
			<p>
				This man loved to work, and he especially loved working for
				those he loved and called friend. Never did he miss an
				opportunity to give his blood and sweat to make someone’s live a
				little easier. His heart was full of love. He ensured that all
				he knew understood that the sweat from his brow, the shirt off
				his back or the food on his table was there’s if they wanted it
				or not. His life was one dedicated to service. Even after many
				years of working hard and building the city around us, he could
				not let his hands sit idly by. Whether it’s helping someone move
				house, snow-blowing a neighbors yard, or assisting here at St
				Olaf’s, service was a key value of Jorge that everyone here has
				had the blessing of.
			</p>
			<p>
				But as the saying goes, work hard, play hard. Never had I had
				more fun with a single human, and got in more trouble. Whether
				we were golfing, skiing, having a quick beer, or getting lost
				somewhere we probably shouldn’t have been. Never did Jorge pass
				up the opportunity for some fun with his friends and family. In
				looking back at some old pictures, one thing was always
				apparent, George was the life of every party he was at. His
				friendship and adventurous spirit lives on.
			</p>
			<p>
				As George would spin his tall tales, one thing became very
				apparent, this man escaped death countless times. Whether
				putting out an electric fire with a water hose, almost getting
				crushed to death in a mine, putting a match in an gasoline
				reservoir, etc etc etc. Here I want to show what I think was
				George’s favorite award. Here it says “Jorge, Escaping Death”.
				He had a mission on this earth, and regardless of the reckless
				danger he found himself in, or was put in, that mission has been
				completed. George understood his mission on this earth. It was a
				mission of hard work, service, gratitude, and imparting life
				long lessons of these virtues to his family. Where ever his
				guardian angel is, I want to say thank you. You have earned a
				well deserved vacation.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thank you Jorge for the lessons you have given me. I am a
				greater man now due to your tutelage. We are all greater now for
				having you in our lives. Thank you for being an amazing husband,
				father, grandfather, and friend we could have ever needed.
