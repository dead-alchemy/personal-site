				In the great world of smart phones and ubiquitous computing,
				modern marvels have arisen in the form of apps, or small purpose
				applications. These apps provide hours of utility and fun that
				make our modern life a little more engaging. We have seen a
				transition of things once only bound to the physical world move
				to the digital landscape. One such transition has been games.
				Once solely in the domain of our physical world, they have made
				the transition to arcade cabinets, then to computers, to purpose
				built consoles, and now to the smart phone. One such game that
				almost seemed impossible to move was the trading card game
				Magic: The Gathering.
			</p>
			<p>
				Magic: The Gathering is a game with thousands of cards, with an
				infinite number of combinations of their unique interactions.
				The game is also considered{" "}
				<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09828">Turing Complete</a>{" "}
				enabling it to make a computer by various exploitation of its
				rules and game states. How this game was able to be made into a
				mobile phone application is nothing short of a miracle. The
				developer{" "}
				<a href="https://company.wizards.com/en">
					Wizards Digital Game Studios
				</a>{" "}
				has been able to achieve this impossible task. A game once left
				only to be played by gathering friends together, going to
				specialty shops, has now been moved to the phone, freeing the
				game from its mortal shell, and taking a life in the digital
				world.{" "}
				<a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgarena">Magic Arena</a>,
				the mobile phone version of Magic: The Gathering, is my favorite
				app.
			</p>
			<p>
				One of the things that makes me wonder is how this mobile phone
				game can take such different interactions between various cards
				and resolve them quickly and accurately. The cards and
				interactions do not just simply battle each other, but can
				create new cards, negate others, change the rules of the game,
				or even the win conditions. This small app can account for all
				these interactions, make fair and accurate rulings, and do it
				quickly. To me it is amazing how developers were able to take
				such a complicated game and make it small enough to be available
				in a smart phone.
			</p>

				The marvel of the smart phone is that it brings ubiquitous
				computing to the whole world. This computing allows us to do
				tasks that were once reserved for a proper terminal. With the
				app Magic: Arena you can play a game of magic quickly and
				without hassle. In the physical form of the game, set up can be
				quite cumbersome as individuals will need to shuffle their deck
				of cards, cut them, draw their starting hands. If they do not
				like their starting hands, they can mulligan which then starts
				the shuffling over again. Then space needs to be allocated to
				play the game. With the app Magic: Arena, this process can take
				under 10 seconds to play a game instead of several minutes, and
				without the hassle of freeing up space. Also, games can be
				played more quickly as time consuming actions like reshuffling
				decks during a game are automated through the app. It is
				incredible how quickly a game can be played without having to
				deal with physical cards. The speed and comfort of playing a
				game using the app is amazing.
			</p>
			<p>
				What makes this app good is how itâ€™s able to liberate access to
				this game. Once reserved to just card shops and a high barrier
				of entry due to its cost, now is free to play for those who are
				interested. The internet has liberated information and brought
				the world closer. The app Magic: Arena has been able to bring
				the game to everyone using the principles that an open and free
				internet provides. What makes this app good is its ability to
				bring joy to those who love the game. It may make mistakes due
				to errors with coding or have some limitations as it cannot make
				an infinite amount of tokens as can be done in the physical
				game. However, despite these limitations, anyone can enjoy
				Magic: The Gathering.
