			<p>*** Spoilers for the Main Campaign of NieR: Automata*** </p>
			<p>
				A2’s journey is one of grief and loss. When we are first
				introduced to A2, she kills a baby machine. Our first
				introduction is one of malice. When the player meets her again,
				2B asks for 2 things: kill her and protect 9S. Unfortunately, 9S
				sees this interaction without the context of 2B’s request.
				Seeing A2 kill his beloved, the only point of reference he has
				of this character is that she is a cold-blooded killer and one
				who betrayed the organization he works so hard for. This
				provides the player as a perfect backdrop to understand her
				story, and how she copes with the fact she is so alone.
			</p>
			<p>
				As we travel with A2, we being to understand how alone she is
				and where her morals lie. Unlike 9S’s impression, we learn that
				A2 does have morals and is generally a good person or android.
				She does spare the robot Pascal’s life and fights hard to ensure
				that Pascal’s village is protected from danger. At the end of
				Pascal’s character arch, A2 is left with a choice and in a
				similar situation A2 has been familiar with. Regardless of how
				hard A2 fought, she is left with the fact her friends are dead.{" "}
			</p>
			<p>
				With the final choice and actions A2 makes in the game reflects
				her growth as a character. She has fulfilled her promise to 2B
				in protecting 9S and freeing him of his corruption. In these
				last moments of her life, she accepts and is freed from the
				grief of her friends. Her anger and drive to avenge has finally
				subsided. She is left with the satisfaction she will finally
				join the fate of her friends and fallen team, as well as helping
				her once enemy in a quest that they could not achieve.{" "}
