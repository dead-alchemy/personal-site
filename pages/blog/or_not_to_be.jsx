				Oh 9S. What a tragic hero. Someone who is burdened by endless
				curiosity. An android who is cursed to find answers that just
				burden instead of lifting. Throughout this play though I noticed
				the burden of knowledge that 9S is doomed too. Instead of a
				protagonist being uplifted by answers, 9S slowly descends into
				madness by the facts he is learning though out his journey.

				At this point I do not have much more to contribute from what
				was revisited in ending A as it’s largely the same story but
				from a different character’s perspective. I do have a couple of
				highlights from this playthrough that I would like to touch on
				due to there emotional significance to me.
			</p>

				Emil is a complicated character. When we left him in the
				remaster of Replicant he had built himself a new body helping
				Kaine in her quest to resurrect Nier. Those were the people most
				important to his existence. Now 8000 years later, the clones of
				Emil have forgotten about his original purpose. It really is a
				beautiful foil to Automata’s story. One is finding the purpose
				of existence while the other is the rediscovery of why you
				fight. Walking though a field of Lunar Tears and looking at an
				ugly portrait was a perfect cap to Nier’s story.{" "}
			</p>
			<p>
				Nier fought in the wrong. Nier was wrong. Nier did not know he
				was wrong. Nier fought for his goals and what he thought was
				right. Nier just wanted to save the people he loved. Nier damned
				everyone. I do not blame Nier. Nier’s story is a Shakespearean
				tragedy. Automata put the headstone on Niers story and resolved
				all questions that Replicant did not answer. Everyone died. No
				more humans. I just hope that Nier was happy as the world around
				him, the world he fought so hard for, slowly died.{" "}
			</p>
			<p>
				As we round the corner in Automata’s story, I learned to love
				9S. Just a selfless character that works to make the lives
				around him better. Unfortunately, the best parts of his
				character lead to his downfall, but that we will visit after C.{" "}
